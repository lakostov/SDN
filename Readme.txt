This is just a basic app to check for changes in the remote SDN file against a locally stored copy of the SDN and patch the local file with the difference. If given more time I would make a web app with scheduled tasks to push notification or send tweets when change in the remote SDN file is detected and deploy it to azure.

To run the app locally, open the solution in Visual Studio and start the app.
